# WeatherPredictionModel
A machine learning project to forecast future weather conditions based on historical weather data using a time-series deep learning model (LSTM). The model is trained to predict temperature (or other parameters) by analyzing past data like humidity, pressure, wind speed, etc.

📖 About the Project
The aim of this project is to build a weather prediction model using machine learning techniques, particularly focusing on time series analysis. This model can forecast temperature (or other weather parameters) for the next day based on previous trends.

It helps demonstrate how historical climate patterns can be used to predict future conditions using data-driven approaches.
